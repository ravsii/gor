# Go Hot Reload

gorl (Go ReLoad) is a micro-size package with the same goal as
[air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) (which is great btw). It provides live
reload while developing an application, but keeping it dead simple, something
like [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) in JS world does.

## Usage

```sh
gorl run main.go -- --your_arg1=value
```
